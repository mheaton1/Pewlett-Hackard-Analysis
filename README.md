# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis 
###### The purpose of this analysis was to find out the amount of employees that are eligible to retire by their employment title. We also needed to identify employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 
## Results 
###### 1. Out of the 300,025 employees 72,458 are eligible to retire.

###### 3. Out of all the retiring employees only 1549 are eligible for the mentorship program. 
###### 4. Only 2 managers are eligible to retire. 
## Summary 
###### When the "silver tsunami" begins there will need to be 72,458 roles that will need to be filled. I do not think there is enough eligible staff to be able to train the replacements for the wave.
